# ðŸ¦™ LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)

LLaMA, developed by Meta AI, is a family of state-of-the-art open-weight foundational language models that are optimized for research and practical deployment. Designed to be efficient and competitive with large proprietary models, LLaMA has rapidly evolved through several generations: **LLaMA 1**, **LLaMA 2**, and **LLaMA 3 (expected)**.

### ðŸ”¹ [LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971)
**Summary**: Introduces LLaMA 1 models (7B to 65B), showing competitive performance with models like GPT-3 but trained on publicly available datasets and smaller compute budgets.

### ðŸ”¹ [LLaMA 2: Open Foundation and Chat Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288)
**Summary**: Enhanced capabilities, including chat fine-tuning, instruction following, safety training, and release under a permissive open license. Variants include LLaMA 2-7B, 13B, and 70B.

> **Note**: As of early 2025, **LLaMA 3** is expected, focusing on multimodal capabilities and improved efficiency.

## ðŸ“– LLaMA Model Overview

LLaMA models are transformer-based autoregressive language models, optimized for:
- **Performance per token**
- **Scalability across hardware**
- **Open access and transparency**

### ðŸ§© Model Variants:
- **LLaMA 1**: Released Feb 2023; 7B, 13B, 33B, 65B parameters
- **LLaMA 2**: Released July 2023; 7B, 13B, 70B parameters with Chat-tuned versions
- **LLaMA 3** *(Expected 2025)*: Improved multilingual support, longer context, multimodal input

## ðŸ“Œ Key Points to Keep in Mind
- **Open Access**: LLaMA is released with weights for non-commercial research (and broader usage in LLaMA 2).
- **Competitive with GPT models**: Despite lower compute budgets, LLaMA models often match or exceed GPT-3.5 performance.
- **Chat and Instruction Tuning**: LLaMA 2 includes models trained for conversational and instruction-following tasks.
- **Scalable**: Efficient inference on both consumer-grade GPUs and data center setups.
- **Ethical & Safety Training**: Includes reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and toxicity filtering.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with LLaMA 2 (via Hugging Face)
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

model = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)
llama = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model, torch_dtype=torch.float16).to("cuda")

inputs = tokenizer("Hello, LLaMA!", return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = llama.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
